# Extensible Markup Language (XML)

XML is a *markup language* that defines a set of rules for encoding structured documents. XML is just information wrapped in tags.

- XML was designed to store and transport data
- XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable
- XML plays an important role in many different IT systems
- XML is self-descriptive
- XML has no predefined tag
- XML is used in APIs
- XML documents are formed as *element trees*
- All programming languages are equipped with necessary libraries to read and parse XML data

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Peyman</to>
  <from>Mina</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
